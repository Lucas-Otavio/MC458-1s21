# MC458-1s21
My codes for the course MC458 - Projeto e An√°lise de Algoritmos I offered by Eduardo Xavier from IC - UNICAMP in 1s2021.
The course covered mathematical tools for algorithms analysis, design of algorithms by induction, search/sorting/order statistics algorithms, dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
